This is Michael Scott, I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you, manager-a-manager. (cut to the office and cut back) All right, done deal! Thank you very much, sir. Youre a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, Im sorry. Okay. Im sorry. My mistake. (hangs up) That was a woman I was talking to. So. . .she had a very low voice. Probably a smoker. So. . .so thats the way its done.

Cut to Michael, walking to the Dunder Mifflin logo

Michael: (to the camera) Ive been in Dundler Mifflin for twelve years, the last four as regional manager. If you want to come through here, (opens the door to the main office) so we have the entire floor, so this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see, ah this is our receptionist Pam. (goes to the receptionist) Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for for ever, right Pam?

PAM: Well, I dont know!

MICHAEL: If you think shes cute now you should have seen her a couple of years ago! (makes faces)

PAM: What?

MICHAEL: Any messages?
PAM: Yeah, just a fax (hands the fax to Michael).

MICHAEL: Pam, this is from corporate. How many times have I told you that theres a special filing cabinet for things from corporate?

PAM: You havent told me!

MICHAEL: Its called the wastepaper basket. (throws the paper away, laughs) Look at that! Look at that face! (points to Pam)

Cut to Michaels office

MICHAEL: People say Im the best boss. They go, God weve never worked in a place like this before, youre hilarious, and you get the best out of us. I think that pretty much sums it up (shows a mug, Worlds Best Boss) I found it at Spencer Gifts.

Cut to Dwight, grabbing his headset, humming a song, Jim looks at the camera, helpless

Cut to Jim, talking to the camera

JIM: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply to them whether they can pay for it and... Im boring myself just talking about this.

Cut to Dwight and Jim, Michael walks to them

MICHAEL: Wazzaaaaaa?

JIM: Wazza. (to camera) He still loves that after seven years!

Michael and Dwight continue for a while
MICHAEL: (to Jim) What?

JIM: Nothing.

MICHAEL: Ok, all right. See you later.

JIM: All right, take care.

MICHAEL: Back to work.

Cut to Angela, pointing to Kevin that he has something on his face

Cut to Jan, entering

MICHAEL: (talking to Camera) Corporate really doesnt interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan, hello! I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton, right? Not to her face because, not because Im scared of her, because Im not, but yeah.

Cut to Jan, Michael and Pam, sitting in Michaels office

JAN: All right, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?

MICHAEL: Me no get an agenda.

JAN: Im sorry, what?

MICHAEL: I didnt get any agenda.
JAN: Oh I faxed one over to you this morning.

MICHAEL: Really? Cause I didnt... (to Pam) did we get a fax this morning?

PAM: Yeah, the one...

MICHAEL: Why isnt it in my hand? Because a company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So whats the problem Pam, why didnt I get it?

PAM: You put it in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.

MICHAEL: Yeah, that was a joke, that was actually my brothers, it was supposed to be with bills and doesnt work great with faxes.

JAN: Do you want to look at mine? (hands agenda to Michael)

MICHAEL: Yeah. Thank you.

JAN: Ok since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided that we cant justify Scranton branch and the Stanford branch. Michael dont panic--

MICHAEL: Oh ok. No, No no no no this is good, this is fine.

JAN: Michael listen, dont panic. We havent made any decisions yet, Ive spoken to Joshua in Stanford Ive told him the same as you, and its up to either you or him to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.

MICHAEL: Ok no problem.

JAN: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.

MICHAEL: Me no wanna hear that Jan, because downsizing is a bitch, it is a real bitch, and I wouldnt wish that on Joshuas men, I certainly wouldnt wish it on my men, or women present company excluded sorry. Is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?

Cut to Dwight, tapping on Jims right shoulder (while standing left from him.) Jim looks to the right and Dwight walks away laughing

Cut back

MICHAEL: Question: how long do we have to (phone rings) Oh, Todd Packer, terrific rep, do you mind if I take it?

JAN: No, go ahead.

MICHAEL: (picks up) Pac man!

PACKER: Hey, big queen!

MICHAEL: Oh, thats not appropriate.

PACKER: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?

MICHAEL: I dont know what you mean.

PACKER: Look, Ive been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?

MICHAEL: (hangs up) Oh my god! Thats so horrifying! Horrible Horrible person!

JAN: So do you think we can keep a lid on this for now? I dont want to worry people unnecessarily.

MICHAEL: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.

DWIGHT: Its overlapping. Its all coming over the edge. One word, two syllables: demarcation.

Cut to Jims desk, hes put pencils between their desks as a fence. Dwight arrives

DWIGHT: You cant do that.

JIM: Why not?

DWIGHT: Safety violation, I could fall and pierce an organ.

JIM: (crosses fingers) Well see (Dwight smashes all the pencils away with his phone) (to camera) This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesnt bother me.

Cut to Dwight, talking to the Camera

DWIGHT: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here even brought it up on my interview. I say, bring it on!

Cut to Pams desk, Michael is standing there

MICHAEL: I think Im a role model here, I think I garner other people respect.

Cut to the office

MIICHAEL: Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP

MICHAEL: You dont know what it is!

DWIGHT: Can you tell them, with my permission?

MICHAEL: I dont need your...

DWIGHT: Permission granted. Go ahead

RYAN: (outside the conference room, on the phone) I heard they might be closing this branch down, Thats just Thats just the rumor going around this is my first day I dont really know.

OSCAR: Yeah, but Michael what if they downsize here?

MICHAEL: Not gonna happen

STANLEY: It could be out of your hands, Michael

MICHAEL: It wont be out of my hands, Stanley, ok? I promise you that.

STANLEY: Can you promise that?

DWIGHT: On his mothers grave.

MICHAEL: Well, eh no. Yeah it is a promise, and frankly Im a little bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

STANLEY: Its just that we need to know

MICHAEL: Hold on a second, I think Pam wanted to say something, Pam? You had a look that you wanted to ask a question, just then?

PAM: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

MICHAEL: Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.

DWIGHT: Pam, information is power.

STANLEY: So you cant say for sure whether its gotta to be us or them.

MICHAEL: No no, no Stanley, no you did not see me in there with her. I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and interfere then theyre gonna have to go through me, right? You know, you can go a mess with Joshs people, but Im the head of this family, and you aint gonna be messing with my chillen.

Cut to Jim, talking to the Camera

MICHAEL: What is that?

DWIGHT: (tries to take it out) Thats my stapler.

MICHAEL: No no no, do not take it out! You have to eat it out there, because there are starving people in the world, (laughs) and which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.

DWIGHT: (points to Ryan) Ok, you know what? You can be a witness. (to Michael) Can you reprimand him please?

JIM: (eating Jello) How do you know it was me?

DWIGHT: Its always you. Are you gonna discipline him or not?

MICHAEL: Ooh discipline, kinky! All right, heres the deal you guys, the thing about practical jokes, is that you have to know when to start, as well as when to stop! And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop pulling Dwights personal effects into jello.

PAM: What? Why?

MICHAEL: Why? Well, theft. And stealing.

PAM: Stealing? Um, what am I suppose to have stolen?

MICHAEL: Post-It notes.

PAM: Post-It notes? What are those worth, like 50 cents?

PAM: Are you serious?

MICHAEL: Yeah.

PAM: I cant believe this, I mean, I have never even stolen as much as a paper clip and youre firing me.

It was a young Guatemalan guy, a first job in the country, barely spoke English, came to me and said Mr Scott, would you be the Godfather to my child? Wow, wow, wow. Didnt work out in the end.
